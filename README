MedScript Lite
==============

MedScript Lite is a medical prescription writing software. It is primarily for
medical practitioners for writing prescriptions.

MedScript Lite is the JavaScript implementation of MedScript. It has a limited
feature set. But it can run on any device with a modern web browser.

The purpose of the program is to enable medical practitioners to prepare
computerized prescriptions. The program has been designed after the commonly
used prescription format among the medical practitioners in India.
Inclusion of prescription style of other regions will hopefully be implemented
in future updates.

File
----

The program uses a custom file format mpaz (Medical Prescription Archive -
Zipped). It is a zip file in a specific format which includes:

1. A meta.json file containing file type and mpaz version.
2. A prescription.zip file containing the actual prescription.
3. An attachment folder containing attached files.
4. A template folder containing the bundled prescription template. This
feature is not supported in MedScript Lite.

Optionally the mpaz archive may also include an S/MIME signature and
certificate for authentication, but it is not implemented in MedScript Lite.

The structure of the mpaz file is as follows:

    <filename>.mpaz (zipped file)
    |-- meta.json (e.g. {"type": "MedScript", "version": "<mpaz version>"})
    |-- prescription.json (Prescription object in JSON format)
    |-- template (template for rendering, unsupported in MedScript Lite)
    |   |-- index.html (Jinja2 template)
    |   |-- <other template files e.g. CSS>
    |-- attachment (directory containing attachments)
    |   |-- <attached files>
    |-- signature (optional: S/MIME signature, unsupported in MedScript Lite)
    |-- certificate.pem (optional: full certificate chain including end-user, intermediates and root certificate)

Install
-------

To use MedScript Lite, you can git repository and build the app from source.
The following commands can be run in a GNU/Linux terminal.

1. Clone the git repository.

    git clone https://code.agnibho.com/repo/medscript-lite.git

2. Enter the cloned directory.

    cd medscript-lite

3. Run the app.

    npm run serve

This will create a local web server and serve the app from there. It can be accessed
at localhost:8080 from any modern web browser in the local system.

4. Build the app (optional).

    npm run build

This will create a "dist" directory containing the compiled app. This
directory maybe placed in a server for online use.

Usage
-----

MedScript Lite has a very intuitive interface.

The home screen contains the options to open a file, create a new file,
editing prescriber information and the information about the app.

### Creating a prescription

A new prescription can be created by clicking on the "New" button. The
prescription editing screen will open. The required data can be entered in the
form.

The parts of a prescription are as follows:

1. ID
2. PID
3. Name
4. Date of Birth
5. Age
6. Sex
7. Address
8. Contact
9. Diagnosis
10. Extra
11. DAW (dispense as written)
12. Mode (consultation mode e.g. tele-consultation)
13. Note (clinical notes)
14. Report (available reports)
15. Advice
16. Investigation
17. Medication
18. Additional
19. Certificate
20. Attachment (files can be attached with the prescription from this option)

After editing the "Save" button below can be used to save the data in a
mpaz file and download it. The "Render" button will render the prescription
into a printable format. The "Cancel" button can be used to cancel the edits
and return to the home screen.

### Opening a prescription

The home screen has the option of opening a prescription. A prescription can
be opened by selecting the file in the home screen and clicking the "Open"
button.

### Rendering a prescription

The prescriptions can be rendered and subsequently printed. To render a
prescription, click on the "Render" button in the edit screen. The rendered
prescription can be printed or converted to PDF by using the print to pdf
option in the browser.

### Template

The program uses nunjucks (similar to Jinja2) template for rendering the
prescription. Two templates (one for default prescription and one for medical
certificates) are included with the app. Custom templates are not supported.

Note that MedScript Lite do not include the templates in the mpaz file.

### Medical Certificate

The certificate text area can be used to write a medical prescription. Select the
medical certificate template from the edit screen for proper rendering.
